what is collections & modules
modules--small programs to excute specific tasks like installing packages on servers
collections--collections are group of modules, roles & resources thqat can be used to automate set of tasks

what is ansible?
Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool developed by Red Hat that is used to manage  varioud IT NEEDS  SUCH as configuration management, application deployment, infrastructure provisioning, and orchestration. 
It uses simple, human-readable YAML files called playbooks to describe automation jobs and operates in an agentless manner, communicating over SSH.

Key Features:
Agentless: No need to install software on managed nodes.

YAML-based Playbooks: Easy-to-read configuration files.

Idempotent: Ensures operations produce the same result even if run multiple times.

Modules: Reusable, built-in, or custom code to perform tasks.

Scalable: Can manage from a few machines to thousands.

Working with Remote Servers using Ansible
Installation and Setup:
Ansible is installed on a control node, also referred to as the Ansible Admin Node or Ansible Controller Node.
Managed nodes do not require Ansible installation, just Python and SSH access.
___________________________________________________________________________________________
Connectivity and Communication:
Ansible uses SSH for secure communication with remote servers (managed nodes). No additional SSH software installation is required on the
managed nodes as they typically come with SSH by default.

Agentless Nature:
Being agentless, Ansible doesn't require any agent software to be installed on the remote nodes, making it lightweight and reducing
management overhead.
Example: If you have 100 servers to manage, you don't need to install Ansible on all of them. Only the control node needs Ansible installed.

Execution Model:
Ansible operates on a "push model" where it pushes small programs, called modules, to the remote nodes to execute tasks.
Each task is executed by the corresponding module on the remote server using the server's Python interpreter.
Example: To update a package on all servers, Ansible pushes a package management module to each server, executes it using Python, then
cleans up after the task is complete.

Push Model and Agentless Architecture:
The push model ensures that changes are initiated from the control node, allowing for centralized management and execution of tasks.
The agentless architecture simplifies setup and reduces the potential attack surface since there's no need to manage software agents on
managed nodes.
